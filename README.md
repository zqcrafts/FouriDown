# FouriDown: Factoring Down-Sampling into Shuffling and Superposing (NeurIPS 2023)

## Framework

FouriDown, as a generic operator, comprises four key components: 2D discrete Fourier transform, context shuffling rules, Fourier weighting-adaptively superposing rules, and 2D inverse Fourier transform. These components can be easily integrated into existing image restoration networks.

## Feature Visualization

The model equipped with FouriDown generates much unique and strong global responses. In contrast, the model with other down-sampling method responds weakly to these regions.

## Feature Spectrum Visualization

Compared to other methods, our FouriDown adaptively adjusts the high and low frequencies, resulting in a wider-band response in the output feature spectrum. Contrasted with previous methods that used fixed frequency aliasing patterns, our approach activates a broader bandwidth on the spectrum, bringing the enhanced performance in image restoration.
